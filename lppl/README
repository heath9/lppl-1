Operating System
================
lppl and related scripts have been tested on CentOS 5.
It is likely that they would work on other versions of Linux.


Dependencies
============

levmar-2.4 
Available from: http://www.ics.forth.gr/~lourakis/levmar/
Change line INC and LIBDIR in Makefile to reflect your installation directory

lapack
Available from the packages lapack-3.0-38.el5 and lapack-devel-3.0-38.el5
from the base repository.

blas
Available from the packages blas-3.0-38.el5 and blas-devel-3.0-38.el5
from the base repository.

popt
Available from the package popt-1.10.2.3-22.el5_7.2

In Ubuntu 16.04, the installation requires levmar-2.6 plus the following
packages:
sudo apt-get install libblas-dev liblapack-dev cmake libf2c2-dev
Additionally, edit CMakeLists.txt and change
  TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(lmdemo ${LIBS})
to
  TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(lmdemo -lm ${LIBS})




Compilation
===========
In the directory lppl, edit Makefile to change the levmar directories and 
to set the desired CFLAGS (compilation options for debug and testing)
$ make 

Optionally, to test that the source code is correct:
$ utest

A number of executables will be created (lppl, gen-lppl, etc.). For help on 
their usage:
$ lppl --help
$ gen-lppl --help
etc.

Add the directory lppl to your path.


Scripts
=======
The subdirectories under gen contain Perl and gnuplot scripts to generate 
synthetic data and plot summary statistics with gnuplot.

For example, under dftp:
$ gen.pl
$ gnuplot C.gpt
